This is a solver/generator for Nurikabe puzzles. The write-up is [here](iacgm.pages.dev/projects/nurikabe). If you just want to use the solver's interactive TUI, you can clone the repo and run the command below:

```
cargo run --release --bin entry
```

It's also built as a library, so could be embedded into other projects.
